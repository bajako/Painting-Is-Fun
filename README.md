It's a simple painting tool created with my 6 years old daughter in mind :smiley:
She had a lots of fun painting trees, houses and anything else you can imagine :milky_way:

Maybe you'll try too :wink:

## Why randomColor?
You may ask. Honestly? When for a first time we got in touch I became captivated.
I know, it's complicated, hard to explain... but that how it is :tada: :smirk:
